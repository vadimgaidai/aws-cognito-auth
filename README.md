# Turborepo starter

Before proceeding with the project setup, make sure your computer is properly configured for development. The following tools and software must be installed:

- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). We recommend installing the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version. To verify if Node.js is installed, run the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```
  You should see a version number. If not, install Node.js.
- **npm**: These are package managers used to install project dependencies. `npm` comes bundled with Node.js
  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```
- **Git**: You need Git installed for cloning repositories and managing version control. You can download it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/). To verify the installation, run:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
- **Use the tools**: Our project use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Make sure youâ€™re familiar with Typescriptâ€™s best practices and enable an ESLint and Prettier plugin for your IDE.

ðŸ’¡ Make sure your code is formatted with Prettier and is free from any ESLint error before you submit a pull request:

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `api`: a [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) app
- `dashboard`: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) and [MagicUI](https://magicui.design/docs) shared by both `dashboard` and `landing` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `@repo/tailwind-config`: `tailwind` configurations for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

```bash
pnpm dev:dashboard
```

```bash
pnpm dev:api
```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

```bash
pnpm build:dashboard
```

```bash
pnpm build:api
```

### Add package

You need to check [documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/package-installation)

```bash
pnpm add <package> --filter=<workspace name>
```

Only adds the new dependency if it is found in the workspace.

```bash
pnpm add -w <package>
```

### Docker Compose Command

The project uses Docker Compose to manage containers

```bash
pnpm docker-compose-up
```

```bash
pnpm docker-compose-down
```

### Migration

A [migration](https://orkhan.gitbook.io/typeorm/docs/migration) is just a single file with sql queries to update a database schema and apply new changes to an existing database. To correctly manage migrations you need to run commands while in the folder with the desired application. For example `apps/api`

```bash
pnpm migration:run
```

```bash
pnpm migration:generate --name=<migration name>
```

```bash
pnpm migration:revert
```

### Add UI component

The project uses two component libraries: [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) and [MagicUI](https://magicui.design/docs)

Each of them has its own CLI for more convenient component addition. In the project, we use the [magicu-cli](https://magicui.design/docs/cli) variant, which can work in tandem with [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

```bash
#add Shadcn UI component
pnpm ui:add --shadcn <component name>
```

```bash
#add Magic UI component
pnpm ui:add <component name>
```

### Building packages/ui

This example is set up to produce compiled styles for `ui` components into the `dist` directory. The component `.tsx` files are consumed by the Next.js apps directly using `transpilePackages` in `next.config.js`. This was chosen for several reasons:

- Make sharing one `tailwind.config.js` to apps and packages as easy as possible.
- Make package compilation simple by only depending on the Next.js Compiler and `tailwindcss`.
- Ensure Tailwind classes do not overwrite each other. The `ui` package uses a `ui-` prefix for it's classes.
- Maintain clear package export boundaries.

Another option is to consume `packages/ui` directly from source without building. If using this option, you will need to update the `tailwind.config.js` in your apps to be aware of your package locations, so it can find all usages of the `tailwindcss` class names for CSS compilation.

For example, in [tailwind.config.js](packages/tailwind-config/tailwind.config.js):

```js
  content: [
    // app content
    `src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`,
    // include packages if not transpiling
    "../../packages/ui/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
```

If you choose this strategy, you can remove the `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` dependencies from the `ui` package.

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```bash
#cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```bash
npx turbo link
```
